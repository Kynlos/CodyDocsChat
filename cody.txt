**Cody is an AI coding assistant that writes, fixes, and maintains your code. **

It uses AI and a deep understanding of your codebase to gather context that helps you write and understand code faster.

Cody connects seamlessly with codehosts like [GitHub](https://github.com/login?client`id=e917b2b7fa9040e1edd4), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign`in) and IDEs like [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai) and [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-sourcegraph-cody--code-search). Once connected, Cody acts as your personal AI coding assistant, equipped with a comprehensive understanding of the following three crucial elements:

1.  Your entire codebase
2.  Vast knowledge of open source code
3.  Extensive training data for code understanding and problem-solving
